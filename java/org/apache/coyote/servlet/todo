Changes  (compared with catalina classes):

- removed interfaces and intermediary classes
- removed notification/listener -> can be added back in super or in a lighter way
- removed JMX ( can be added in extending classes )
- removed facades
- removed 'sandbox' mode ( can be added back if needed, maybe using super )
- dispatcher - remove support for non-http requests
- remove 'container servlets'
- valves: ....
- configuration: remove ApplicationParameter, minimal context config.

The old model: hierarchy of abstract classes and interfaces, with eventually one or 2 concrete
classes having all the features.

New model: basic ( but working ) base classes, can be extended to add functionality.

Broken:
- Contest: getResource, needs to be reimplemented using file system instead of naming
- 

Missing:

- Globals
- RequestUtils
- Realm
